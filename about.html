        I was born and raised in Easton, Massachusetts which is roughly 40 minutes south of Boston. I am currently a freshman at the University of Rhode Island
        studying Computer Science. I have always been interested in computers and how they work, so Computer Science has allowed me to explore that topic along with
        other important topics surrounding it. I plan on focusing more on Cyber Security and Web Development when the time comes and I hope to find a job 
        in either field. When I am not coding, I am playing basketball or watching any sport on television. I am a very big Boston sports fan, 
        but my favorite team is the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association.
