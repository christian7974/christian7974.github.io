        This page includes the final project for CSC 106. It is a game called "Jetpack Adventures" where the game is the user having my bitmoji doding various obstacles. It is a sidescroller game that was made using the Khan Button class and the Khan Hoppy Beaver game. The game was made using the programming language Javascript and the ProcessingJS Library. I used Agile Software Development (SCRUM) to plan out the features of the game and how to use my time wisely. The user must dodge rectangular obstacles as well as snakes which come at the user much faster than the grey obstacles. The user must also collect coins while dodging all of these obstacles. I learned that if you plan a software out over multiple weeks, it is not only less stressful but also easier to get a completed, finished product. The hardest part of the project was what I wanted to do, since there are so many options to make software for, however I felt a game would be the most enjoyable to make and test, since I am just playing a game.
            <br>
            To play: Use the spacebar to jump and dodge the obstacles. Pause the game by pressing the left arrow key and unpause by pressing the right arrow key. Press the up arrow key to respawn after you die or win.
