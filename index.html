        This website contains my various projects that I have completed throughout the semester in the course "CSC 106: The Joy of Programming".
        This website was made using the source code control system known as GitHub and written in the markup language HTML. One difficulty I had when making
        the website was producing the tables. It was challenging for me to remember the proper HTML tags that are associated with making a table so I had to
        constantly look back at my notes in order to place the tags in the correct location.
