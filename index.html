        This website contains my various projects that I have completed throughout the semester in the course "CSC 106: The Joy of Programming".
        This website was made using the source code control system known as GitHub and written in the markup language HTML. One difficulty I had when making
        the website was putting the links in the correct places. Luckily, I figured it out using div-tags and placing the div-tags strategically on the page using
            the margin property and the padding property in CSS.
