        Here are my various Javascript projects that I have made while in CSC: 106.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Me as a Bitmoji</h2>
            In this project, I have made a bitmoji of myself based on a picture I took of myself.
            <br>

            <h2>Dancing Bitmoji</h2>
            Here is my bitmoji dancing around the screen. To see the bitmoji move, refresh the page and he will appear to move around the canvas.
            <br>
            <script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/tropeano_dancingbitmoji/4693728109477888/embed.js?editor=no&buttons=no&author=no&embed=yes">
            </script>
            
            <h2>Racing Bitmoji</h2>
            Now my bitmoji must race a frog and a bunny for bragging rights. To see the race again, refresh the page and see who wins every race.
            <br>
            <script src="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/tropeano_racingbitmoji/5732668820111360/embed.js?editor=no&buttons=no&author=no&embed=yes">
            </script>
            
            <h2>Dancing Bitmoji (coded with Functions)</h2>
            This is the same dancing bitmoji, however I have used the knowledge of functions to code it which makes the code look neater and visually appealing.
            <br>

            <h2>Racing Bitmoji (coded with Functions)</h2>
            This is the same racing bitmoji, however made each racer as a function so I could race as many people as I want. In order to add a racer, I would
            just have to call the function instead of writing all of the code again.
            <br>

            <h2>Resizing Me</h2>
            This program resizes my bitmoji and a smaller version of the bitmoji can be drawn across the screen my repeatedly pressing the mouse, 
            almost as a paintbrush.
